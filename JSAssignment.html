		<!--Canvas to draw the cat on-->
		<canvas id="myCanvas" width="800" height="500" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
		<!--Buttons with the links to their JavaScript functions-->
		<button onclick = "sleep(ctx)">Sleep</button>
		<button onclick = "sit(ctx)">Sit</button>
		<button onclick = "drawToggleTail(ctx)">Toggle Tail</button>
		<button onclick = "initial(ctx)">Reset</button>
		<!--Application guide-->
		<p>When you open the application you will see a cat standing at the bottom of the canvas. 
		   You can control the cat by using the buttons to the right of the canvas. The sleep 
		   button will make the cat go to sleep and if you click this while the cat is sleeping 
		   it will wake up and be standing. The sit button will make the cat sit down and if you 
		   click this while the cat is sitting the cat will go back to standing. The toggle tail 
		   button will allow you to change the tail from pointing up to pointing down and vice versa. 
		   The reset button will restore the cat to how it was when you opened the application.
		</p>
		<p>You can also control the cat by clicking on the canvas. You can change the position of 
		   the cat on the canvas by clicking where you want it to move to. The cat will appear in 
		   the x position of the mouse click. The vertical position on the cat will not change. If 
		   you click on either of the eyes the eyes will go from open to closed and vice versa. You 
		   can also click on the cat's mouth to make it yawn and the cat will continue to yawn until 
		   you tell it to stop by clicking the button again.
		</p>   
		<p>You can toggle the cat's eyes and its yawning status as long as it is not sleeping. The 
		   cat must be standing if you want to toggle the tail. Whenever the cat moves to another 
		   part of the canvas it will be displayed as it was when you opened the application. This 
		   application contains no animations.
